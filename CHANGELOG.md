# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Due to the complexity of Azalea and the fact that almost every Minecraft version
is breaking anyways, Semantic Versioning is not perfectly followed.

Not all changes will be documented here, but an effort is made to at least
write down most non-trivial breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- This changelog. To see changes before this update, look at the git commits.
- azalea and azalea-client now have a `packet-event` feature, which can be disabled for efficiency if you're not using `Event::Packet`.
- `StartJoinServerEvent` can now be used to join servers exclusively from the ECS without a Tokio runtime.
- `FormattedText::to_html` and `FormattedText::to_custom_format`.
- Add auto-reconnecting which is enabled by default.

### Changed

- [BREAKING] `Client::goto` is now async and completes when the client reaches its destination. `Client::start_goto` should be used if the old behavior is undesired.
- [BREAKING] The `BlockState::id` field is now private, use `.id()` instead.
- [BREAKING] Update to [Bevy 0.16](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-16/).
- [BREAKING] Rename `InstanceContainer::insert` to `get_or_insert`.
- ClientBuilder and SwarmBuilder are now Send.

### Fixed

- Clients now validate incoming packets using the correct `MAXIMUM_UNCOMPRESSED_LENGTH` value.
- Send the correct UUID to servers in `ClientboundHello` when we're joining in offline-mode.
- Several protocol fixes, including for ClientboundSetPlayerTeam and a few data components.
- Update the `InstanceName` component correctly when we receive a respawn or second login packet.
- Block shapes and some properties were using data from `1.20.3-pre4` due to using an old data generator (Pixlyzer), which has now been replaced with the data generator from [Pumpkin](https://github.com/Pumpkin-MC/Extractor).
