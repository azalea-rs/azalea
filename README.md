## Features

-   [Accurate physics](https://github.com/azalea-rs/azalea/blob/main/azalea-physics/src/lib.rs) (but some features like entity collisions and water physics aren't yet implemented)
-   [Pathfinder](https://azalea.matdoes.dev/azalea/pathfinder/index.html)
-   [Swarms](https://azalea.matdoes.dev/azalea/swarm/index.html)
-   [Breaking blocks](https://azalea.matdoes.dev/azalea/struct.Client.html#method.mine)
-   [Block interactions & building](https://azalea.matdoes.dev/azalea/struct.Client.html#method.block_interact) (this doesn't predict the block interactions/placement on the client yet but it's usually fine)
-   [Inventories](https://azalea.matdoes.dev/azalea/struct.Client.html#impl-ContainerClientExt-for-Client)
-   [Attacking entities](https://azalea.matdoes.dev/azalea/struct.Client.html#method.attack) (but you can't get the entity at the crosshair yet)

## Docs

The "stable" documentation is available at [docs.rs/azalea](https://docs.rs/azalea) and the unstable docs are at [azalea.matdoes.dev](https://azalea.matdoes.dev) (recommended).

## Matrix/Discord

If you'd like to chat about Azalea, you can join the Matrix space at [#azalea:matdoes.dev](https://matrix.to/#/#azalea:matdoes.dev) (recommended) or the Discord server at [discord.gg/FaRey6ytmC](https://discord.gg/FaRey6ytmC) (they're bridged so you don't need to join both).

## Goals

-   Do everything a vanilla client can do.
-   Be intuitive and easy to use.
-   Make it easy to have many bots working at the same time.
-   Don't trigger anticheats.
-   Support the latest Minecraft version.
-   Be fast and memory efficient.

## Non-goals

-   Supporting several versions of Minecraft on the same branch[\*](https://github.com/azalea-rs/azalea-viaversion).
-   Bedrock edition.
-   Graphics.

## Branches

There are several branches in the Azalea repository that target older Minecraft versions.
Most of them are severely outdated compared to the latest version of Azalea.
