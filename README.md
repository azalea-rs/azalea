## ⚠️ Azalea is still very unfinished, though some crates are in a somewhat useable state


I named this Azalea because it sounds like a cool word and this is a cool library.
This project was heavily inspired by [PrismarineJS](https://github.com/PrismarineJS).

## Why

I wanted a fun excuse to do something cool with Rust, and I also felt like I could do better than [Mineflayer](https://github.com/prismarinejs/mineflayer) in some areas.

## Goals

- Do everything a vanilla client can do.
- Be intuitive and easy to use.
- Make it easy to have many bots working at the same time.
- Don't trigger anticheats.
- Support the latest Minecraft version.
- Be fast and memory efficient.

## Non-goals

- Supporting several versions of Minecraft on the same branch.
- Bedrock edition.
- Graphics.


## Stretch goals

- Server implementation.
- Having branches for several popular Minecraft versions.
