## Why

This project was heavily inspired by [PrismarineJS](https://github.com/PrismarineJS).
I wanted a fun excuse to do something cool with Rust, and I also felt like I could do better than [Mineflayer](https://github.com/prismarinejs/mineflayer) in some areas.
Also it's named Azalea because it sounds like a cool word and this is a cool library.

## Goals

- Do everything a vanilla client can do.
- Be intuitive and easy to use.
- Make it easy to have many bots working at the same time.
- Don't trigger anticheats.
- Support the latest Minecraft version.
- Be fast and memory efficient.

## Non-goals

- Supporting several versions of Minecraft on the same branch.
- Bedrock edition.
- Graphics.


## Stretch goals

- Server implementation.

## Branches

There are several branches in the Azalea repository that target older Minecraft versions. It is not guaranteed that they will be up-to-date with the latest version of Azalea. If you'd like to update them or add more, please open a PR.
