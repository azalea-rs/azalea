## ⚠️ Azalea is still super unfinished, you probably shouldn't use it


I named this Azalea because it sounds like a cool word and this is a cool library. This project was heavily inspired by PrismarineJS.

## Why

I wanted a fun excuse to do something cool with Rust, and I also felt like I could do better than [Mineflayer](https://github.com/prismarinejs/mineflayer) in some areas.

## Goals

- Do everything a vanilla client can do.
- Be intuitive and easy to use.
- Bypass most/all anticheats.
- Support the latest Minecraft version.
- Be fast and memory efficient.

## Non-goals

- Supporting many versions of Minecraft (but there might be branches made in the future for some popular versions).
- Graphics.
