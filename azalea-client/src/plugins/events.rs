// (for contributors):
// HOW TO ADD A NEW (packet based) EVENT:
// - Add it as an ECS event first:
//     - Make a struct that contains an entity field and some data fields (look
//       in packet/game/events.rs for examples. These structs should always have
//       their names end with "Event".
//         - (the `entity` field is the local player entity that's receiving the
//           event)
//     - In the GamePacketHandler, you always have a `player` field that you can
//       use.
//     - Add the event struct in PacketPlugin::build
//         - (in the `impl Plugin for PacketPlugin`)
//     - To get the event writer, you have to get an EventWriter<ThingEvent>.
//       Look at other packets in packet/game/mod.rs for examples.
//
// At this point, you've created a new ECS event. That's annoying for bots to
// use though, so you might wanna add it to the Event enum too:
//     - In this file, add a new variant to that Event enum with the same name
//       as your event (without the "Event" suffix).
//     - Create a new system function like the other ones here, and put that
//       system function in the `impl Plugin for EventsPlugin`
